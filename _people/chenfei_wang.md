desp: Chenfei Wang received his B.S. and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Tongji University in 2012 and 2017, respectively. During his Ph.D. studies, he focused on epigenetic reprogramming and its effects on embryogenesis and cell fate determination in mammalian early embryos and SCNT embryos, utilizing computational methods. In 2018, he joined Xiaole Shirley Liu's lab as a postdoctoral researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University, where he developed algorithms for the integrated analysis of single-cell multi-omic data. Currently, he is a Professor at the School of Life Science and Technology at Tongji University. His research centers on developing computational algorithms and conducting big data mining on high-throughput data to understand the roles of gene regulation and cellular crosstalk in cellular and individual phenotypes during disease development and aging. <br/> Dr. Wang is a recipient of the Ray Wu Prize and a participant in the Shanghai Rising Star Program. He has also received support from the Excellent Youth Program and the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. He has published over 20 papers as a corresponding author in journals such as Nature Genetics, Nature Cancer, Cell Stem Cell, Genome Biology, and Nucleic Acids Research.
