# Software
#### Single Cell Multiomics
- [**MetroSCREEN**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/MetroSCREEN) &nbsp; is computational workflow for predicting metabolic activities and regulomes from single-cell RNA-seq data.
- [**Cisformer**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/Cisformer) &nbsp; is a cross-attention-based model for single-cell cross-modality generation between gene expression and chromatin accessibility.
- [**SCRIPro**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIPro) &nbsp; is a tool for evaluating gene regulatory network activities for both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics and multiomics.
- [**SCRIP**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIP) &nbsp; is a tool for evaluating gene regulatory network activities in scATAC-seq data.
- [**SELINA**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SELINA.py) &nbsp; is a deep learning-based framework for cell-type annotation of human scRNA-seq data using large-scale curated references. 
- [**SCREE**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCREE) &nbsp; is a workflow to perform quality control and analyses of multimodal single-cell CRISPR screen datasets.

#### Spatial Multiomics
- [**Cellist**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/Cellist) &nbsp; is a computational method for accurate cell segmentation and signal enhancement on high-resolution spatial transcriptomics.
- [**STRIDE**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/STRIDE) &nbsp; is a topic-model-based deconvolution method for low-resolution spatial transcriptomics by integrating with scRNA-seq.
- [**CCI**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/CCI) &nbsp; Benchmark of CCI prediction tools based on the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data.

#### Single Cell Resources
- [**MetroTIME**](http://wanglab-compbio.cn/MetroTIME/) &nbsp; serves as a comprehensive resource detailing the metabolic heterogeneities and their associated regulomes in pan-cancer fibroblasts and myeloid cells.
- [**TabulaTIME**](http://wanglab-compbio.cn/TabulaTIME/) &nbsp; is a comprehensive tumor microenvironment landscape by integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data.
- [**TISCH**](http://tisch.comp-genomics.org) &nbsp; is a scRNA-seq database that includes over 6M human and mouse tumor scRNA-seq cells, and provides detailed cell-type annotation and gene expression visualization across different cancer types.
- [**HUSCH**](http://husch.comp-genomics.org) &nbsp; is a scRNA-seq database that includes over 3M human normal scRNA-seq cells from 41 tissue/organs, and provides detailed cell-type annotation and gene expression visualization across different tissue/organs.
