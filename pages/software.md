# Software
#### Single Cell Resources
- [**TISCH**](http://tisch.comp-genomics.org) &nbsp;
(Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub) is a scRNA-seq database that includes over 6M human and mouse tumor scRNA-seq cells, and provides detailed cell-type annotation and gene expression visualization across different cancer types.
- [**HUSCH**](http://husch.comp-genomics.org) &nbsp;
(Human Universal Single-cell Hub) is a scRNA-seq database that includes over 3M human normal scRNA-seq cells from 41 tissue/organs, and provides detailed cell-type annotation and gene expression visualization across different tissue/organs.
- [**TabulaTIME**](http://wanglab-compbio.cn/TabulaTIME/) &nbsp;
(Tabula of pan-cancer Tumor Immune Microenvironment) is a comprehensive tumor microenvironment landscape by integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data.
- [**MetroTIME**](http://wanglab-compbio.cn/MetroTIME/) &nbsp;
(Metabolic Regulome of the pan-cancer Tumor Immune Microenvironment) serves as a comprehensive resource detailing the metabolic heterogeneities and their associated regulomes in pan-cancer fibroblasts and myeloid cells.

#### Single Cell Multiomics
- [**SCRIPro**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIPro) &nbsp;
(Single Cell Regulatory network Inference for Spatial Multiomics) is a tool for infering the gene regulatory networks for both single-cell and spatial transcriptomics and multiomics.
- [**SCRIP**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCRIP) &nbsp;
(Single Cell Regulatory network Inference using ChIP-seq and motif) is a tool for evaluating the binding enrichment of transcription regulators at the single-cell resolution based on integration of scATAC-seq and bulk ChIP-seq reference.
- [**SELINA**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SELINA.py) &nbsp;
(Single-cELl Identity NAvigator) is a deep learning-based framework for cell-type annotation of human scRNA-seq data using large-scale curated references. 
- [**SCREE**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/SCREE) &nbsp;
(Single-cell CRISPR screen data analysEs and perturbation modEling) is a workflow to perform quality control and analyses of multimodal single-cell CRISPR screen datasets.

#### Spatial Multiomics
- [**Cellist**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/Cellist) &nbsp;
(Cell identification in high-resolution Spatial Transcriptomics) Cellist is a computational method for accurate cell segmentation and signal enhancement on high-resolution spatial transcriptomics.
- [**STRIDE**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/STRIDE) &nbsp;
(Spatial TRanscrIptomics DEconvolution by topic modeling) is a topic-model-based deconvolution method for low-resolution spatial transcriptomics by integrating with scRNA-seq.
- [**CCI**](https://github.com/wanglabtongji/CCI) &nbsp;
Benchmarking of CCI prediction tools based on the integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data.
